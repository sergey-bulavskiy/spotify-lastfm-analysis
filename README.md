# spotify-lastfm-analysis
Pet project to create some fancy graphs based on lastfm/spotify profiles. 

Planned things to do: 
* Analysis of discover weekly: 
  - Distribution of genres that are in discover weekly. 
  - Diffs of discover weekly playlists, to see how much playlist changes from week to week. (Additionally add correlation with scrobbles per-week)
* Graphs with per-day/week/month scrobbles.
Nice-to-have telegram notification about not scrobbling for a while (maybe need to re-link spotify to lastfm)
* Distribution of genres-by-year/week/month.
